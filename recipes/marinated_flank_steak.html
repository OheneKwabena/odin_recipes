    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      Flank steak is a lean cut of beef that comes from the cow's lower
      abdominal muscles. It's a relatively tough cut that's low in fat, which
      means a few things: Flank steak doesn't need to be trimmed, it's
      inexpensive compared to other cuts, and it benefits greatly from
      marination.

      >Depending on the degree of doneness you're after. This marinated flank
      steak should be totally cooked after about 5 minutes of grilling time on
      each side. Of course, tastes and preferences will vary. <br />Pair your
      marinated flank steak with a side salad, grilled or roasted veggies, or
      something starchy (such as mashed potatoes or French fries).

      <br />
      <li>
        <b>Step 2</b><br />
        Add flank steak to the baking dish; turn several times to coat
