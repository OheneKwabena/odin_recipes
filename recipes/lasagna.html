    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Make the meat sauce. Cook meat with tomato sauce and seasoning and sugar
        in measured quantities. Cook for <em>1 hour and 30 minutes</em> stirring
        often
      </li>
      <li>
        Boil noodles in salted water for 8-10 minutes. Drain and rinse the
        noodles in cold water. Add ricotta cheese, egg, remaining tablespoons of
        parsley and add some salt to taste
      </li>
      <li>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F(190 degrees C</li>
      <li>
        To assemble, lay a foundation of meat sauce at the bottom of the bowl
        and arrange 6 noodles length-wise over the meat sauce. Spread ricotta
        cheese mixture. Top with mozzarella cheese slices and sprinkle with 1/4
        cups meat sauce with 1/4 cup Parmesan cheese. Repeat layers, and top
        with remaining mozzarella and Parmesan cheese. Cover with foil: to
        prevent sticking, either spray foil with cooking spray or make sure the
        foil does not touch the cheese.
      </li>
      <li>
        Bake in the preheated oven for 25 minutes. Remove the foil and bake for
        an additional 25 minutes. Rest lasagna for 15 minutes before serving.
